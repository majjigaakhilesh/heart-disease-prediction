## Introduction

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project employs machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the risk of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). It includes various attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health metrics.

### Features
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Angina
- ST Depression
- Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target (Presence or absence of heart disease)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Installation

To run this project, you can clone the repository and open it in Google Colab. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on "File" -> "Open notebook" -> "GitHub".
3. Enter the repository URL and open the notebook.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset into the Colab environment.
2. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Choose a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
5. Train the model on the training data.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
7. Visualize the results.

## Model Evaluation

After training, we evaluate the model using:
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Classification Report

These metrics help us understand the model's effectiveness in predicting heart disease.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively utilized for predicting heart disease. Future improvements can include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and experimenting with different algorithms for better accuracy.
